# GFX Libraries

(c) 2003 Beem Media

These are 2D drawing libraries for DirectX 7 and DirectX 8. They are not very interesting at this point. The DirectX 7 version is used to power ScrollGIN (though now ScrollGIN also has a DirectX 11 renderer).

GFXG8Demo requires the DirectX 8 SDK to build, this is not included in installations of Visual Studio and must be acquired separately.
