# GFX Libraries

(c) 2003 Beem Media

These are 2D drawing libraries for DirectX 7 and DirectX 8. They are not very interesting at this point. The DirectX 7 version is used to power ScrollGIN (though now ScrollGIN also has a DirectX 11 renderer).

GFXG8Demo has been updated to use DirectX 9 (it was formerly DirectX 8) that way it can be built with Visual Studio 2022 which still included DirectX 9.
