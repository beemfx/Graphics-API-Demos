# D3DDemo

(c) 2003 Beem Media

This was written as a learning exercise for Direct3D. It actually started as
Direct3D 8, but was upgraded to Direct3D 9 (and that is the only version that
exists today). It in itself is not very interesting, and it's not even useful
since DirectX 9 is obsolete (and this used the fixed function pipeline on top
of that).

It does feature MD3 file support (the Quake 3 Arena file forma) fairly
robustly (but again fixed function pipeline so no shader support). Which is
probably the most interesting thing about it. It really exists only for novelty
at this point, and doesn't even represent my capabilities as a game programmer.
Being that it is over 13 years old.
